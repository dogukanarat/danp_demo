# DANP Demo

## Overview
This repository contains the demo application for DANP project, built on the Zephyr RTOS. It demonstrates the implementation of client-server communication, utilities, and other features using the Zephyr framework. The project is designed to run on the Nucleo L476RG board.

## Repository Structure

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the application, including client, server, and utility modules.
- **include/**: Header files for the project.
- **libraries/**: Additional libraries used in the project, such as `danp` and `danp_ftp`.
- **boards/**: Board-specific configuration files, including overlays for the Nucleo L476RG.
- **build/**: Build artifacts generated by the Zephyr build system.
- **modules/**: External modules and dependencies integrated into the project.

## Prerequisites

1. **Zephyr SDK**: Ensure you have the Zephyr SDK installed. Follow the [Zephyr Getting Started Guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html) for setup instructions.
2. **West Tool**: Install the `west` tool for managing Zephyr projects.
3. **Board**: Nucleo L476RG development board.

## Building the Project

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /home/dogukanarat/zephyrproject/danp_demo
   ```
2. Build the project for the Nucleo L476RG board;
   ```bash
   west build -b nucleo_l476rg
   ```
   1. Build the project for dgram server
      ```
      west build -b nucleo_l476rg -p always -- -DSERVER_MODE=1 -DDGRAM_MODE=1
      ```
   3. Build the project for stream server
      ```
      west build -b nucleo_l476rg -p always -- -DSERVER_MODE=1 -DDGRAM_MODE=0
      ```
   4. Build the project for dgram client
      ```
      west build -b nucleo_l476rg -p always -- -DSERVER_MODE=0 -DDGRAM_MODE=1
      ```
   5. Build the project for stream client
      ```
      west build -b nucleo_l476rg -p always -- -DSERVER_MODE=0 -DDGRAM_MODE=0
      ```

## Flashing the Firmware

1. Connect the Nucleo L476RG board to your computer via USB.
2. Flash the firmware onto the board:
   ```bash
   west flash
   ```

## Cleaning the Build

To clean the build directory, run:
```bash
west build -t clean
```

## Configuration

Project-specific configurations are defined in the `prj.conf` file. Modify this file to adjust settings as needed.
